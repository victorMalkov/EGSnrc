\section egs_kerma_intro Introduction

The C++ application \c egs_kerma is an advanced EGSnrc application whose
main goal is the estimation of kerma in a volume defined by one or
more geometrical regions by means of a track-length estimator.
The efficiency of the calculation can be increased by several orders
of magnitude by using the variance reduction technique (VRT) known as
\ref egs_kerma_FD "forced detection" (FD). It can also be used for estimating the total and
differential photon fluence in the scoring volume.

This code is by no means in its final stage. It is still very experimental
and it has been cleaned up for release in the hope it will be useful
to EGSnrc users. A number of collaborators have been using it for some time and
have helped with their comments and bug reporting.

\section egs_kerma_geometry Geometries

Geometries are specified in an input file as explained in
the \ref Geometry "geometry module". Besides the simulation geometry, a geometry
should be defined that encompasses all scoring regions to be able to take advantage
of the \ref egs_kerma_FD "FD" VRT.

\section egs_kerma_sources Particle source definition

Any source from the \c egs++ \link Sources particle sources module\endlink can be used. Here is an example for
an isotropic point source of 40 keV photons placed at 100 cm on the negative z-axis:

\verbatim
:start source:
    name    = isotropic
    library = egs_isotropic_source
    charge  = 0

    ### source shape
    :start shape:
        type = point
        position = 0, 0, -100
    :stop shape:

    ### source spectrum
    :start spectrum:
        type = monoenergetic
        energy = 0.04  # MeV
    :stop spectrum:

:stop source:
\endverbatim

<b>BEWARE:</b> No check is made for the charge of the initial particles.
Although kerma is only defined for neutral particles such as photons and neutrons,
one could potentially want to calculate kerma for secondary neutral particles
generated by charged particles.

\section egs_kerma_options Scoring options input block

Kerma in the scoring volume can be calculated
for several geometries at once. Hence a correlated scoring
of kerma ratios can be requested by linking any combination of
two calculation geometries. In cases of small differences between
these geometries, the kerma ratios will be strongly correlated,
resulting in a significant reduction of the variance.
Correlated scoring is requested by assigning two geometry names to
the <b><code>correlated geometries</code></b> key.
A pseudo input block of such an input is shown below:

\verbatim
:start scoring options:

    :start calculation geometry:
        geometry name  = name_1
        cavity regions = list_of_cavity_region_indices
        cavity mass    = total cavity mass in grams
        excluded regions = list_of_regions # exclude particles touching these regions
    :stop calculation geometry:
    :start calculation geometry:
        geometry name  = name_1
        cavity regions = list_of_cavity_region_indices
        cavity mass    = total cavity mass in grams
        excluded regions = list_of_regions
    :stop calculation geometry:
    :start calculation geometry:
        geometry name  = name_2
        ...
    :stop calculation geometry:
    ...
    :start calculation geometry:
        geometry name  = name_n
        ...
    :stop calculation geometry:

    correlated geometries = name_i name_j
    ...
    correlated geometries = name_k name_l

    ### fluence scoring requested (common to all calculation geometries)
    :start fluence scoring:
        minimum energy = Emin
        maximum energy = Emax
        number of bins = N
        scale          = linear # linear or logarithmic
    :stop fluence scoring:

    ### E*muen file (could also be E*mutr): absolute or relative file path
    emuen file = absolute_file_name

     ### geometry for forced-detection (if omitted, an analog scoring is used)
    cavity geometry = cavity # For forced detection

:stop scoring options:
\endverbatim

The meaning of the various keys defining a calculation geometry should
be self explanatory. The reason one must specify the cavity mass is that
due to the generality of the geometry package it is not possible to
automatically compute the cavity volume and therefore the user must supply
this information for proper normalization. Geometrical regions spanning the
scoring volume (cavity) are provided via the
<b><code>cavity regions</code></b> key. If no valid region is entered or
this input is ignored, no kerma to the cavity of the calculation geometry
is calculated.

\section egs_kerma_calculation Kerma scoring

Kerma calculations require a file containing pairs of energy \f$ E \f$ and
\f$ E \times \frac{\mu_{en}}{\rho} \f$ values for the medium of interest.
This allows a faster evaluation of the
summation over all contributing particles by saving the multiplication operation.
The full name (absolute path) of this file <b>must</b> be provided using the
<b><code>emuen file</code></b> key as shown in the above example.

Kerma for medium \f$m\f$, \f$K_m\f$ is computed by summing up the individual contributions
of N photons crossing the scoring volume \f$V\f$ using the expression

\f[
K_m=\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_i \cdot \frac{l_i}{V} \cdot E_i \cdot
\left(\frac{\mu_\mathrm{en}}{\rho}\right)_i^m
\f]

The example file <em>emuen_icru90_1.5MeV.data</em> contains \f$ E \times \frac{\mu_{en}}{\rho} \f$
values for air on a logarithmic energy scale from 1 keV up to 1.5 MeV. These values
were calculated with the <em>g</em> application using the following (non-default)
transport parameters:

\verbatim
##############################
:start mc transport parameter:

 Global ECUT = 0.512
 Global PCUT = 0.001

 Photon cross sections = mcdf-xcom # XCOM with renormalized PE xsections
 Pair cross sections = nrc
 Triplet production = On
 Radiative Compton corrections = On

 Brems cross sections = nrc
 Electron Impact Ionization = penelope # Could be also ik

:stop mc transport parameter:
##############################
 \endverbatim

This file is distributed with <em>egs_kerma</em> in the same folder.

\section egs_kerma_FD Variance reduction: Forced Detection

If the user provides the name of a defined geometry encompassing all scoring regions,
then a variance reduction technique known as <em>forced detection</em> can be used
which increases the calculation efficiency by about 3 orders of magnitude compared
to an analog calculation. The name of such a geometry should be provided to the
application via the key <b><code>cavity geometry</code></b> in the
<b><code>scoring options</code></b> input block.
If no such geometry is provided, kerma is calculated in an analog manner,
\em i.e. by scoring every time a photon crosses the scoring volume.

The usual approach to compute kerma \f$K_m\f$ for medium \f$m\f$ is to score the individual
contributions from photons crossing the scoring region. This approach is already several
times more efficient than using the kerma approximation where a full simulation of
all photon interactions is performed assuming electrons deposit their energy on the spot.
One can go one step further and estimate the contribution to kerma from any photon
that could potentially cross the scoring region due to its direction. An algorithm
to determine whether the direction of the photon intercepts with the scoring region
 needs to be implemented, as well as a ray-tracing algorithm to account for the attenuation
through the geometry. This way, one does not have to wait until the photon reaches
the scoring region to estimate its contribution to the kerma and a more efficient
sampling of all possible contributions is achieved. This approach is equivalent to
running N separate MC simulations where in the \f$ k^{th} \f$ simulation, only the contribution
to the kerma from particles interacting \f$k-1\f$ times is scored. After running all these
simulations, they can be added together to obtain the total kerma.

Kerma to medium \f$m\f$ is computed by adding up the contribution
from all photons aimed at the <b><code>cavity geometry</code></b> using the expression

\f[
K_m=\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_i \cdot \frac{l_i}{V} \cdot E_i \cdot
\left(\frac{\mu_\mathrm{en}}{\rho}\right)_i^m \cdot
e^{- \sum_{j=1}^{N_j} \mu_{ij} \cdot l_{ij}}
\f]

with \f$N_j\f$ the number of regions crossed by the \f$ i^\mathrm{th}\f$ photon,
\f$\mu_{ij}\f$ the attenuation coefficient in region \f$j\f$ and \f$l_{ij}\f$
the path across region \f$j\f$.

\section egs_kerma_fluence Fluence scoring

A photon fluence calculation can be requested using the following input block:

\verbatim
:start scoring options:
    ...
    :start fluence scoring:
        minimum energy = Emin
        maximum energy = Emax
        number of bins = N
        scale          = linear, logarithmic
    :stop fluence scoring:
:stop scoring options:
\endverbatim

Differential fluence \f$ \phi_j \f$ is calculated by scoring the volume-averaged
track length for particles with energies E between \f$E_j\f$ and \f$E_{j+1}\f$
using Chilton's fluence concept for any sampling volume V:

\f[
\phi_j=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N_j} w_i \cdot l_i}{V}
\f]

where \f$\displaystyle l_i\f$ is the length of the \f$\displaystyle i^{th} \f$
particle track. The width of the energy bins is defined by \f$ E_{min} \f$,
\f$ E_{max} \f$ and the number of bins N. Total fluence \f$ \Phi \f$
is calculated as the sum over all contributions to the fluence

\f[
\Phi=\sum_{j=0}^{N-1} \phi_j
\f]

The <b><code>fluence scoring</code></b> input block can be used
to request the photon fluence spectrum in a volume \f$V\f$
defined by the <b><code>cavity regions</code></b>.

\section egs_kerma_output Output

Kerma to medium in the volume of interest for each geometry as well as kerma
ratios requested by the user are output
to an *.egslog file (batch execution) or to the screen (interactive execution).
If a fluence calculation is requested, total and differential photon fluences
are also output for each calculation geometry. Additionally,
a <a href="http://plasma-gate.weizmann.ac.il/Grace/">Grace</a> plot of
the differential fluence for all geometries is generated in a file (*.agr).

\section egs_kerma_usage Usage

As any other EGSnrc application, \c egs_kerma can be started from the command line
using
\verbatim
egs_kerma -i input_file [-p pegs_file] [-o output_file] [-b] [-s] [-P N -j i]
\endverbatim
where the arguments in square brackets are optional. With the \c -o option
one can change the name of the output files (by default \c input_file.xxx
is used, where \c xxx is \c .egslog for the log file, \c .egsdat for the
data file, etc.). With \c -b one specifies a "batch" run, \em i.e. the
output is redirected to \c output_file.egslog. With \c -s one can force
\c egs_kerma to use a simple RCO instead of a JCF-RCO in parallel runs
specified with <code>-P N -j i</code>, where \c N is the number of parallel
jobs and \c i the job index. Note that one Unix-type systems it is easier
to use the \c exb command to submit parallel jobs
\verbatim
exb egs_kerma input_file pegs_file [p=N] [batch=pbs]
\endverbatim
where the \c batch option specifies the queuing system to be used.
If using a \em pegsless input file, then <b><code>pegs_file</code></b> must be substituted with
the keyword <em>pegsless</em>.
The EGSnrc GUI can be also used, see
see PIRS-877 for more details on running EGSnrc applications.
